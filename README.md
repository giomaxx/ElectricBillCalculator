Tkinter bill splitter


The problem:
My neighbor and I receive an electric bill that we need to split between ourselves.
The bill has a cost that needs to be splitted equally and another one that needs to be splitted proportionally.
The bill also provides information about the total amount of electricity comsumed.
I take care of reading the partial consumptions of one user at the beginning and end of the billing period.

The solution:
Take the total consumption, take the partial consumption, do the proportions and split the bill accordingly.

A very simple tool I created to make my life easier.
